# Machine Learning and Data Science

## Welcome to my Machine Learning and Data Science Portfolio!

In this repository, you will find a collection of ML projects I have worked on, such as:
  
- 🚢 titanic.py, a program to predict whether a passenger of the titanic survived
- 🛍️ shopping.py, a program to predict whether a customer of an online website would make a purchase
- 🛑 traffic.py, a program to detect and classify stop signs
