Question Answering (QA) is a field within natural language processing focused on designing systems that can answer questions. Among the more famous question answering systems is Watson, the IBM computer that competed (and won) on Jeopardy!. A question answering system of Watsonâ€™s accuracy requires enormous complexity and vast amounts of data, but in this problem, the goal was to design a very simple question answering system based on inverse document frequency.

The goal of my question answering system was to perform two tasks: document retrieval and passage retrieval. My system had access to a corpus of text documents. When presented with a query (a question in English asked by the user), document retrieval first identifies which document(s) are most relevant to the query. Once the top documents are found, the top document(s) were subdivided into passages (in this case, sentences) so that the most relevant passage to the question can be determined.

To find the most relevant documents, I used tf-idf to rank documents based both on term frequency for words in the query as well as inverse document frequency for words in the query. Once the most relevant documents were found, a combination of inverse document frequency and a query term density measure was used to score passages and provide an answer.
