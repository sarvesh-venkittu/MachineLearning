# Machine Learning

## Welcome to my Machine Learning Portfolio!

In this repository, you will find a collection of ML projects I have worked on, such as:
  
- 🚢 titanic.py, a program to predict whether a passenger of the titanic survived
- 🛍️ shopping.py, a program to predict whether a customer of an online website would make a purchase
- 🛑 traffic.py, a program to detect and classify stop signs
- 🤔 questions.py, a program to create an AI that can answer questions
- 🎲 montecarlo.py a program that utilizes the Monte Carlo method to approximate the value of pi
