This csv files used for this program come from the "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" Kaggle competion. This was the first Kaggle competition I participated in, and I got a score of 0.67224.

- train.csv contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board and reveals whether or not they survived.
- test.csv contains just the passenger details.
- using train.csv, the task was to create result.csv, a 2-column csv file with test.csv's passenger information and the prediction.
